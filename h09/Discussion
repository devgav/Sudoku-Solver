	When my algorithm attempted to solve example 3 I noticed that the time to find a solution was longer than
the other sudoku puzzles. I think this is due to the way that the AI escargot sudoku is set up. It is set up
in a diagonal fashion which means that there can be many possibilities in each cell and my code would have to
go through each individual solution before coming up with an answer. I also think that the way that I have 
set up the algorithm with a bruteforce technique makes the code take longer to run. 

	The worse and best case of this bruteforce algorithm is that it will find all the correct values on it's
first try and we don't have to backtrack. In the worse case scenario would be that every value we enter for each
cell is incorrect and we would have to backtrack multiple times to solve our sudoku. In this case our algorithm
backtracked the AI Escargot many times. The AI Escargot was an example of a worse case scenario.
